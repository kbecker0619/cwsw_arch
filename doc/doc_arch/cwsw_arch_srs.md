# Requirements: CWSW Arch Component

<!-- Note: This document is not pure Markdown format: it is intended to be used inside of a
Doxygen project, and therefore contains some embedded Doxy commands -->

## Purpose of Component

The CWSW Arch Component provides the foundation of the dependency tree for the CWSW suite of 
reusable software components. They are primarily intended for use in an embedded environment, but they may find utility in a variety of environments.

The Arch component contains a minimal set of functions, with supporting User Defined Types, 
macros and function-like macros.
