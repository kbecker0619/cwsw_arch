# Reusable Component : MCU Architecture Support (Core Files)

## Overview

This folder is contains the implementation files for the MCU architectures supported by the CWSW Software libraries.

This folder contains no dependencies on other external CWSW components; however, this severely limits the ability of the demonstration application.

For a more representative demonstration environment, along with Unit Test projects, see the CWSW_Arch integration project.

---

~~There is one directory for each supported architecture; in your build system, simply exclude all architectures except for the one around which your project is built.~~

~~Please see the detailed design documentation, created by Doxygen, for detailed information.~~
